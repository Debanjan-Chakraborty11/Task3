# 📚 Simple REST API for Book Management

A Node.js and Express application implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a list of books. This project was completed as part of an internship task focusing on backend API development fundamentals.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to build a simple, stateless REST API where data is stored **in-memory** (using a JavaScript array instead of a database) to demonstrate proficiency with:
* Setting up a basic **Node.js** and **Express** server.
* Defining RESTful API endpoints (`/books`).
* Implementing the four core HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** Minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
* **Postman:** Used for testing and interacting with the API endpoints.
